# simpleGNN

This repo consists of a python implementation of the general GNN architecture for expositional purposes. If adapts the principles of the original Graph Neural Network specification written by Scarselli et. al. *The Graph Neural Network Model*

We aim to greatly simplify the graph neural network by focusing on the aggregation of local spatial characteristics without the non-linearization seen in the popular GCN model. It turns out that this has little to do with the power of the GNN (see Felix Wu et. al. 2019).
